# jQuery Melissa Data Property

This is a work in progress.

An API wrapper for the [Melissa Data Property Web service](http://wiki.melissadata.com/index.php?title=Property), used to get information about individual homes.

Melissa Data provides an example on their wiki that uses JavaScript to make requests to their Property Web service, but it uses ActiveX plugins for the AJAX requests, making it useless in all but the most insecure versions of Internet Explorer.

## Requirements

1. [Melissa Data](http://www.melissadata.com/) account with a subscription to their Property service. You'll need to know your user ID, as it is used as the API key
2. jQuery

## Usage
